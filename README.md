The Mtc project will attempt to be a base MVC framework

Created by [Mathias Bosman]. ([@mathiasbosman])

### Version
1.0.0.

### Tech

BHive is written in PHP and uses (or will use) a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [jQuery] - duh, yet to be implemented
* [FuelPHP] - not really implemented, but I got some inspiration from the project.
* [Google Materidal Design Lite] - againt not really implemented but got inspiration here

Some extra on the side information:
* Editor: [Atom.io] and some packages
